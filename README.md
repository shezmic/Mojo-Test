# Mojo Calculator

Welcome to the Mojo Calculator project! This simple calculator application is designed as a fun exercise to help you learn and practice coding in Mojo.

## About Mojo

Mojo is an exciting new programming language that combines the simplicity of Python with the performance of systems programming languages. It's designed to be particularly useful for AI and machine learning applications.

## Project Overview

This calculator app demonstrates several key features of Mojo:

- Function definitions with type annotations
- Basic arithmetic operations
- User input handling
- Control flow (if statements, while loops)
- Python interoperability

## Getting Started

To run this project, you'll need to have Mojo installed on your system. Once you have Mojo set up, you can run the calculator by executing the main Mojo file.

## Learning Objectives

By working with this project, you can:

1. Understand Mojo's syntax and how it differs from Python
2. Practice working with Mojo's type system
3. Explore how to handle user input in Mojo
4. Learn about function definitions and calls in Mojo
5. Gain experience with control flow structures in Mojo

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with this basic calculator, try extending it! Here are some ideas:

- Add more complex mathematical operations (e.g., power, square root)
- Implement memory functions (store and recall values)
- Create a graphical user interface for the calculator
- Optimize the code for better performance

Happy coding in Mojo!
